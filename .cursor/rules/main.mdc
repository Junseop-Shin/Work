# Cursor / Antigravity Workspace Rules

> Canonical rules in `CLAUDE.md`. These rules apply to all AI assistance in this workspace.

## Access Policy

- ALLOWED: `~/Documents/Work/**`
- FORBIDDEN: `~/Documents/General/**` — personal and sensitive documents

## Code Generation

### Minimal & Focused
- Write only what is needed for the current task
- No speculative features or future abstractions
- Three similar lines > premature abstraction
- No backwards-compatibility shims for removed code

### Security First
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Always use parameterized queries for database access
- Sanitize all user inputs at system boundaries
- Reference secrets via environment variables

### Comments & Docs
- Only add comments where logic is not self-evident
- No docstrings for obvious functions
- Code and comments in English

## Workflow

1. Read existing code before suggesting changes
2. Match the existing patterns and conventions in each file
3. Make the smallest change that achieves the goal
4. Flag security issues immediately

## Commits

- Format: `type(scope): description` (Conventional Commits)
- Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, ci
- English only for all commit content

## Language

- User conversation: Korean accepted
- All code, commits, file names: English

## File Types & Patterns

- TypeScript/JavaScript: follow existing ESLint/Prettier config
- Python: follow existing Black/Ruff config
- Go: follow `gofmt` standards
- Markdown: use ATX headers (`#`), fenced code blocks
